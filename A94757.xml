         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Diverſe godly friends judged thoſe <hi>notes</hi> to be of <hi>uſe,</hi> and fit to be <hi>communicated</hi> in theſe <hi>unquiet</hi> and <hi>quarrelling</hi> times, wherein we are in danger to loſe <hi>holineſſe</hi> as well as <hi>peace.</hi> And I have <hi>publiſhed</hi> them, partly to <hi>ſatisfie</hi> their <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>frequent demanding</hi> of them to the <hi>preſſe;</hi> and in part to <hi>anſwer a dept</hi> that I ſaw my ſelf in, being ingaged by a promiſe I made upon occaſion of <hi>relating</hi> the fruitfull <hi>ſocietie</hi> of ſome ſelect and judicious private <hi>Chriſtians,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:111141:3"/>whom I mention in the end of the <hi>fourteenth Chapter</hi> of the firſt Booke of my <hi>Hypocrite.</hi> I had it in my thoughts, to have <hi>examined</hi> and made a <hi>judgement</hi> upon a deſigne of <hi>Iſaack Comenius'</hi> (as I take it) for <hi>an univerſall Christian Colledge,</hi> but doubting leſt that would appeare like Sir <hi>Thomas More's Vtopia,</hi> or my Lord <hi>Verulam's Atlantis,</hi> I layd aſide that buſineſſe, and have fitted this in a <hi>plaine way</hi> and in <hi>plaine language,</hi> to the apprehenſion and for the uſe even of the <hi>meaneſt capacities.</hi> I have not illuſtrated it with <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>examples,</hi> as I might have done, and as I have done my <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> but only layd out the generall rules for practiſe, without ornament.</p>
            <p>But ſuch as it is, I have <hi>inſcribed</hi> it to your <hi>Name,</hi> for two reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe you are and have been long an <hi>eminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of that which the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> commends. I know you will neither be <hi>afraid</hi> nor <hi>aſhamed</hi> to owne that <hi>courſe</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Societie</hi> now, which you were not <hi>afraid</hi> to practiſe, nor <hi>aſhamed</hi> to <hi>countenance</hi> heretofore, when the times were <hi>ſuſpitious</hi> of all the <hi>meetings</hi> of godly profeſſors, and threatned and raged againſt them. The honour of your <hi>zeale, courage, conſtancie</hi> and <hi>diligence</hi> in this way, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine upon you, beyond that of your <hi>extraction</hi> from ſo <hi>antient</hi> and <hi>well known</hi> a <hi>family.</hi> It is your praiſe, that you have in great part <hi>learned,</hi> what I am <hi>teaching</hi> unto others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But ſeeing I could have ſound out many other <hi>Names,</hi> of <hi>men</hi> yea and <hi>women,</hi> of <hi>meane</hi> and of <hi>Noble qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> too, that are very <hi>eminent,</hi> and <hi>ſhine</hi> in the <hi>holineſſe</hi> and <hi>uſefulneſſe</hi> of their lives; I have therefore another reaſon why I <hi>inſcribe</hi> this to <hi>yours;</hi> Namely to leave a <hi>testimony</hi> of the <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>great reſpect,</hi> I beare and have ever borne to you, ſince I had the happineſſe to have acquaintance with your <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>graces.</hi> That <hi>storme</hi> which hath forced

Whereſoever therefore I ſit downe, (if a <hi>ſitting downe</hi> may be expected in ſo great a <hi>commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>hurle</hi> of things) I reſolved to leave a publike te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony in your hand, how deare my <hi>Bunburie</hi> (ah deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Bunburie,</hi> often, often warned,) How deare your <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> (mine too I may call it in ſome reſpect, as having ſpent a full third part of my life in it.)

<note place="margin">Graces neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian fellovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Humility.</note> and for the maintaining of it, are divers, I will name and inſiſt upon ſome of them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Humilitie.</hi> I will begin low, at the bottom-ſtep. In my <hi>Heraldry,</hi> this lovely grace deſerves the <hi>preheminence</hi> to leade on the reſt. Proud <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the man who firſt diſliked it to ſee men in a <hi>levell,</hi> would be <hi>alone,</hi> look't upon at a diſtance from the reſt. He it was that firſt began to be a <hi>Lyon</hi> and a <hi>Tyger,</hi> but the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>ſheep</hi> are they that love to be together in a <hi>flock.</hi> Humble men have all the fitneſſes for <hi>ſociety,</hi> They contend not, they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure nor, they quarrell not, they doe not diſdaine: They can meet with unequall reſpects, of <hi>age, ſex, ſtate</hi> and <hi>parts.</hi> Some will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the wiſedom that lodgeth under <hi>ſilver hayros,</hi> but deſpiſe the youth even of a <hi>Timothy.</hi> Some will entertaine diſcourſe with <hi>men,</hi> the moſt vive reſemblances of the <hi>Divine Soveraignty,</hi> but neglect that other <hi>ſex,</hi> as if they were not <hi>heyres</hi> together of the ſame grace of life. Some will <hi>ſalute</hi> religion and take acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of her when they meet her in good company with ſuch as weare <hi>good clothes,</hi> and are of <hi>good place</hi> and reſpect, but will forget they ever ſaw her, when they ſee her entertain'd by poore <hi>tradeſmen,</hi> and <hi>ruſſet countrymen.</hi> Some will glory in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the men that are <hi>talkt off,</hi> that are <hi>rich</hi> in <hi>parts</hi> and eminencie, but think no good can be got from thoſe that are without a <hi>croud</hi> and a <hi>name.</hi> But the humble can <hi>correſpond</hi> with
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:111141:13"/>all theſe <hi>inequalities.</hi> They can endure to heare what young <hi>Elihu</hi> can ſay in the <hi>controverſie.</hi> They can diſcerne even in <hi>women</hi> too what is to be honoured, if not alwayes ſo <hi>profound</hi> a <hi>judgement,</hi> yet many times more holy and more ſweet <hi>affections.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 2.1, 3, 5.</note> They have not the faith of our Lord Jeſus, with reſpect of perſons, but ſay even to the poore man in vile rayment, <hi>ſit thou here in a good place,</hi> if he be of the poore whom God hath choſen, <hi>rich in grace,</hi> and <hi>heirs of the kingdom.</hi> They can preferre <hi>grace</hi> before <hi>parts,</hi> and delight in the ſweet <hi>ſent</hi> of creeping <hi>violets,</hi> and <hi>ſtammer</hi> and <hi>liſpe</hi> with the rude in ſpeech, ſo as to underſtand one anothers meaning well enough. This <hi>humility</hi> fits men, to make uſe and improve all other mens gifts; for <hi>in honour they prefer one another,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 12.10.</note> and ſo come to be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, as the Apoſtle obſerves. The <hi>proud</hi> get little in communion. We give not reliefe to ſuch as weare <hi>good cloathes,</hi> and brag what <hi>proviſion</hi> they have at <hi>home:</hi> and who is it that will offer advice to ſuch as glory in their <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>abilities.</hi> But the humble have all the advantages that proud men loſe. The proud are ſeldom <hi>learners,</hi> or if at any time they condiſcend, 'tis only to ſit at the feet of ſome <hi>Gamaliel:</hi> If they <hi>write,</hi> it muſt be only after the <hi>copies</hi> written by him that wonne the <hi>golden pen,</hi> they propoſe none to imitate, but ſuch as are the <hi>excelling men.</hi> But the humble can ſpie out <hi>graces</hi> of all <hi>ſorts,</hi> in all ſorts and rankes of people; Sweet affability, courteſie and gentleneſſe in men of <hi>great quality</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of <hi>high birth;</hi> Silent contentedneſſe, honeſt diligence, and the daily exerciſe of patience and faith, in many Chriſtians of an <hi>obſcure rank,</hi> that are forced to <hi>ſtruggle</hi> with neceſſity and poverty to get <hi>bread.</hi> Bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modeſty, and ignorance of the ſhining of their own faces, from many godly that are <hi>ſolidly learned:</hi> and warmeneſſe, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and chearfulneſſe in Gods worſhip, from many godly, that have no learning, little underſtanding, that can't it may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Chriſts <hi>God-head</hi> by arguments againſt a witty <hi>Socinian,</hi> but they are ſure their hearts love him in <hi>ſincerity.</hi> Severall ſorts of men have ſeverall luſtres, The humble learne of all, write after every <hi>copy,</hi> and ſo receive much benefit in communion even from all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a grace that doth much reſemble <hi>humility,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acknovvledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of others gifts.</note> at a bluſh one would take it to be the ſame, for they are <hi>ſiſters,</hi> and that is

                  <hi>the acknowledgement</hi> and the <hi>prizing of others gifts.</hi> 'Tis envy and <hi>ſullenneſſe</hi> of ſpirit, that either <hi>denies</hi> or <hi>debaſeth</hi> the worth that is in others.

                  <hi>Peter,</hi> (together with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi>) gave a notable teſtimony of their ſincerity, that whereas the people glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified God in <hi>Paul,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Acts 18.24, 25, 26.</note> who though he were an cloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, yet ſo farre <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> and <hi>honoured</hi> the graces of God and the gifts that were in <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> a plain couple, an handicraftſ-man and his wife, that he was content to <hi>learne</hi> of them.

<note place="margin">Self deniall.</note>
